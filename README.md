# Dynamic_Functional_Connectivity
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with abnormal static resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), especially in the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, little is known about PTSD-related dynamic changes in functional connectivity. We hypothesize that patients with PTSD is associated with reduced temporal variability of functional connectivity than trauma-exposed controls based on compromised abilities of PTSD patients to dynamically adjust behaviors and thoughts to changing conditions and a preoccupation with trauma-related experiences. We will compare patients with PTSD (N~=1500) to trauma-exposed controls (N~=1500) from ENIGMA-PGC PTSD project on dynamic rsFC based on the standard deviations in rsFC of amygdala, hippocampus and mPFC over a series of sliding windows. The proposed research may advance knowledge of fluctuating communications among brain systems in PTSD.
